I have thought about this project not only as a means to fluidify my workflow but also as a form  of exercise.
After all, what is a mage withut a few hexes of their own?

First and foremost, I have managed to separate this program into a few more or less self contained smaller files.

As of now I do not yet posses the foresight to see al of the possible challenges that writing this tool may pose

Configuration:
	- It is hard to tell exactly what piece of information is required to setup and run this tool.
	For now it saves a directory for each website and whether or not it is a git repository,
	such that I may know whether or not to git push once a problem is solved without having to check the directory

Login:
	- I initially had a pretty good idea of how this would be achieved, but upon examining the Project Euler page,
	I realized I had not accounted for something: Captcha
	Unfortunatly, my spellbook is devoid of Captcha thwarting incantations, I shall thus refer
	to the council of all exisiting mages and craft one of my own
	
	How many more surprises of this kind lie ahead? One can only guess
