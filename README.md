# Challenger
Unleash the Code

Once upon a time there lived a mage
The maged liked to practice magic through tests made by other mages
Unfortunately, test grounds are all over the place
The mage is tired of alternating between might and day
Shortcuts are never the same everywhere
He smiles, for he knows...
He can automate that
"Ei, zwei, drei!"

# What even ..?

Challenger is a command line tool that lets you easily solve coding challenges from leetcode, advent of code and the euler project, all from your favorite text editor.

## ETC

This will be a longer and more complete tool than ones i've previousy done, and it is likely to take weeks if not months to complete.

## Specification

- User may choose which website to pull problems from or can be given random questions from a random website.
- User may choose the language
- Log in to the respective website using github (eventually more ways will be suported)
- Create the necessary files (a file for the prompt, a file to write the code to and a potential additional file for input -as it appears in advent of code-)
- Send the problems / solutions to the websites for validation and notify if it passes or fails
- Time the user and keep track of problem comletion time in a file
- Save the problem solution and log in the apprpriate directory

- When set up, challenger should take 3 different directories to which it should save the data
